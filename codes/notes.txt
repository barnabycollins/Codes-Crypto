Tried Huffman using dahuffman library: achieved ~1.6 compression ratio
Tried LZW: achieved ~1.8-1.9. Struggled with special case of repeated items before realising that an exception could be made to handle it.

Could try running LZW on bits rather than characters?

- collapse repeated letters
- find common tags (\aaaa, \aaaa{bbb})
- find common words
