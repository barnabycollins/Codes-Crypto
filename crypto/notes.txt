ECB encrypts every 8-byte section of input separately.

- Started by bruteforcing 8-byte strings via hex but quickly realised this would take a very long time (34 years iirc?)
- Downloaded a dictionary and started compiling all possible what3words addresses - also was taking a long time
- Limited the generated addresses to ones with 16 characters - also was taking ages
- Noticed what3words only used words with 4+ characters, eliminating words of length 1-3 - didn't help much as there are more long words than short
